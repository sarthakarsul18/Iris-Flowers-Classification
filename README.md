"Iris Flowers Classification" 
"This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify iris flower species based on the famous Iris dataset. The dataset includes 150 samples with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. After visualizing the data with pairplots, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. An SVM model with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel is trained and evaluated using K-Fold cross-validation. The model achieved an accuracy of 97%, and predictions are made to classify the iris species."
